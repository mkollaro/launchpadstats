Installation
============

You can install the last release with pip:

::
    $ pip install launchpadstats

Alternatively, you can install from source with:

::
    $ python setup.py install


The tests can be run either with

::
    $ python setup.py tests

or with

::
    $ pip install tox
    $ tox

This will execute the tests with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3, additionally also
checking for pep8 errors. You might need to install extra Python interpreters
if you miss one of the versions, but you could also just limit it to running
with a specific version:

::
    $ tox -e py27  # run tests using Python 2.7
    $ tox -e py33  # run tests using Python 3.3
    $ tox -e pep8  # only run pep8 checks
